you're opposed to creating a Discord account, Github issues also work.

# Code Contribution

* If you're thinking of implementing something, it's best to chat with us
  about it first. That way we can vet your idea and make sure your efforts won't
  be in vain.
* Before making a PR, make sure to
  * Test your code; `cargo test` and `cargo clippy`.
  * Format it; `cargo fmt`.
  * [Run the benchmarks](benchmark_results.md).
    This verifies compression and
    decompression works for each synthetic dataset, which occasionally catches
    strange cases the tests miss.
    Also, if your change might affect performance, compare relevant runtimes to
    the benchmarks on the main branch.

Looking for ideas on what to contribute? Grep through the repo for concrete
TODOs, or look at our
[project ideas](https://github.com/pcodec/pcodec/wiki/pcodec-project-ideas)
for harder, underspecified problems.

# Testing

## Rust

`cargo test`

## Python

From a venv with `maturin` installed, and from `pco_python/`, run
`maturin develop` to recompile and install the python package into your venv.
Then you can run `pytest --doctest-glob='*.md'`.

## Java

With Maven installed, and from `pco_java/`, run `mvn test -P rust` if you want
to recompile the Rust code, or just `mvn test` if not.

# Deploying Packages

## Rust / Crates.io

`pco` and `pco_cli` are manually deployed with `cargo publish` from a local
clone of the repo.

## Python / PyPi

`pco_python` is packaged by
[a Github workflow](../.github/workflows/python_publish.yml)
whenever the release name contains "Python". This runs a lot of maturin builds,
each of which produces a dynamic library for a targets (in the sense of OS /
hardware tuples).
If all builds succeed, each such package is automatically and separately
published to PyPi.

## Java / JVM / Maven Central Repository

`pco_java` is similarly packaged by
[a Github workflow](../.github/workflows/java_publish.yml)
whenever the release name contains "Java".
Unlike Python, libraries for all platforms get bundled into a single JAR
before being published to Maven Central Repository staging.
After the upload, someone (probably @mwlon) needs to log into the Maven Central
Repository website and promote it from staging to prod if it looks good.
